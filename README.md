# DNA Overview

## Providers

DNA is a Windows&trade; desktop program that performs powerful data management of Carbon compatible licensing databases. DNA internally uses the following two licensing provider packages to connect to the databases.

1. **Example Licensing Provider**  
   A publicly available GitHub repository named [Carbon.Example.Licensing.Provider][git1] contains a Carbon compatible licensing provider that uses SQL Server as the backing storage. The readme in the repo describes the conventions of the Carbon licensing system and providers.
2. **Red Centre Licensing Provider**  
   A proprietary licensing provider that is only used by applications hosted in the [Red Centre Software][rcs] Azure subscription. There is a [NuGet package][nug1] available.

Both of the providers implement the `ILicensingProvider` interface, so DNA can load and use them interchangeably. DNA uses a dialog to prompt for options specific to each provider and select the active one.

The following tables describe the options for each provider.

### Example Licensing Provider

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| ADO.NET Connect | A connection string in the format expected by the .NET database driver. |
| Product Key | A key that must be provided by Red Centre Software to verify that the licensing provider is known to the distributor of Carbon licences. |

### Red Centre Licensing Provider

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| API Key | A key that must be provided by Red Centre Software to allow Access to their proprietary licensing web service. |
| Service Base Address | The base Uri of the licensing web service. |
| Timeout | The timeout seconds of the web service. Default is 30. |

## Technical Notes

The original code for DNA was intended to be as *neutral* as possible, having no troublesome dependencies on external libraries. However, the [MVVM Toolkit][mvvmkit] has become quite popular recently, and it does dramatically reduce the amount of code required to implement notify properties and commands, so it's gradually being introduced into the code. Most notify properties are now simple fields annotated with `[ObservableProperty]`, but most of the commands are still `RoutedUICommand` bound to the main window in the traditional way. It's planned to convert most of the commands to `[RoutedCommand]` annotated methods, but it's estimated to be several hours of delicate work.
